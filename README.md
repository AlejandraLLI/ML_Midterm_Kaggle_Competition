# ML_Midterm_Kaggle_Competition

This repository has the code and solutions submitted to the Kaggle Competition **"Image based door sensor (AM 2017)"** for the midterm exam of the Machine Learning Course. 

The objective is to predict if the garage door is open or closed processing images taken by a camera. 
This task was accomplished estimating linear models, Ridge regressions, Loess regressions and neural networks. 

Note that all coding and comments are in Spanish. There is no html or pdf output for the project, only the csv files submitted to the competition and the corresponding scripts. Note that this project was one of the first approaches to R and ML, therefore you won't find any sophisticated codes here.
